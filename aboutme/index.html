    <h2>Randall Eckstein</h2>
    <p>My name is Randall.  I am originally from Utah, though I have spent the last twenty years in China teaching English.</p>
    <p>It was in China that I met my wife.  We were married in 2012, and my son was born in 2014.</p>
    <p>When the pandemic hit, I decided to use the time to learn computer programming.  I had designed web pages in the late nineties, back when everything was hard coded and there was no quick-design software.</p>
    <p>My passion is not actually designing web pages. I love the backend.  I am proficient in C# and Python, and I've dipped my toe into Java.  I'm pursuing a degree in web design and development, because it was the closest degree to software development I could see.</p>
