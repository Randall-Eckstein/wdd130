      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to showcase the content that I have created.  I want to show different platforms (desktop and mobile), as well as different languages (C#, Python, Java, HTML + CSS) used to create my portfolio.  With this proof of concept web-page, I have ambition beyond this class to develop a similar drag-and-drop template for other programmers to showcase their own work.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My current audience is a prospective employer.  A future audience would be similar programmers, offering a showcase for code and projects.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Eckstein Education marries the arts of computer programming and educational software.  Having the experience of twenty years teaching English as a Foreign Language in China, Randall had identified problem areas that most often lie within the Zone of Proximal Development (A term coined by psychologist Lev Vygotsky to define what a person can accomplish with assistance—as compared to what is easy for that person, and what is beyond their abilities.)  Combining these areas with engaging and intriguing visual and auditory feedback not only helped the students in the classroom, but also improved the quality of the teaching within the school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the programs on this site showcase the educational potential of computer programming.  Anything that can be described, vocabulary to be practiced, testing to be conducted, and study-at-home activities can be programmed into a consumable format for young learners and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with educational software, Randall has developed several games independent of learning.  These games make use of old and new ideas alike.  With the power of Unity, Java, C#, and Python, Randall has created games and program for PC and Android alike.

      <h3>Unity and C# Programs</h3>
       <ul>
        <h4>Art Words</h4>
        <img src="images/art-words.png" alt="Art Words Image">
        <p>Art words is a program that combines a child’s love of coloring objects with vocabulary and reading practice.  The teacher will first type in twelve vocabulary words to practice.  These will randomly be spread throughout the game board.  Then an image will be chosen.  Initially white, the students come to the screen one-by-one to touch an image.  Color is added, and students read the words that appear (or say the color if no words were entered).</p>

        <h4>Shape Finder</h4>
        <img src="images/shape-finder.png" alt="Shape Finder Image">
        <p>Combining the love children have for interactive activities with shape recognition and recall, this game allows teachers to select from one to twelve unique shapes (circle, rectangle, trapezoid, etc).  These will be “hidden” behind art scenes.  When students touch the art, for example the horse in the farm scene, the art will disappear and reveal the colored shape.</p>

        <h4>Memory Match</h4>
        <img src="images/memory-match-full.png" alt="Memory Match Image">
        <p>The classic memory game.  Teachers can load up their own 10 images and the game will automatically randomize and link them.</p>

        <h4>Paint Bucket</h4>
        <img src="images/paint-bucket-full.png" alt="Paint Bucket Image">
        <p>Practicing colors has never been easier.  Choose the colors to include in the random selection, and each time the pour button is pressed, colors will be poured into the circle.  Students get to interact and shout out the colors they see!</p>

        <h4>Patterns Never End</h4>
        <img src="images/patterns-never-end.png" alt="Patterns Never End Image">
        <p>Practicing pattern recognition and prediction has never been easier.  This program was built to follow the chapters in a specific book, but it includes vocabulary words as well as sound patterns, shape patterns, color patterns, and image patterns.  From simple ABAB to ABCDABCD.  You can practice it all!</p>

        <h4>Hot Potato</h4>
        <img src="images/hot-potato.png" alt="Hot Potato Image">
        <p>This program is little more than musical and visual feedback for the children’s game of “Hot Potato.”  There are two modes: automatic and manual.  In automatic, the timer will play the music for up to 15 seconds before stopping long enough for students to read a vocabulary word on a card, or perform an action based on teacher’s requirements.  In manual mode, the teacher controls when the music will start and stop.</p>

        <h4>Master Mind</h4>
        <img src="images/master-mind.jpg" alt="Master Mind Image">
        <p>A digital reproduction of the game by the same name.  This game has three levels of difficulty: Easy has five colors to choose from.  Medium has eight colors.  Difficult has eleven.  Can you guess the secret combination in just 10 tries?</p>

        <h4>Goodie Gobbler</h4>
        <img src="images/goodie-gobbler.jpg" alt="Goodie Gobbler Image">
        <p>Travel through space as a planet gobbler.  You are an insatiable ne’er-do-well whose only joy is devouring planets and avoiding asteroids and planet defenders.  Can you pass through all the levels and attain the goal of destroying the universe?</p>

        <h4>Space Trader</h4>
        <img src="images/space-trader.jpg" alt="Space Trader Words Image">
        <p>Travel the galaxy buying and selling product.  Your goal is to upgrade your ship to travel further.  The more you travel, the more you will acquire.  To win, buy a protoplanet and make it habitable.  Retire on your new planet, and enjoy the fine life!</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Java and Python Programs</h3>
      <ul>
      <h4>BitArt</h4>
      <img src="images/bitart.png" alt="BitArt Image">
      <p>Convert words and sentences to their respective bits.  These bits will then be colored to create unique art!  Helps students to visualize how the computer can turn on-and-off markers into letters and punctuation.</p>

      <h4>Break Times</h4>
      <img src="images/break-times.png" alt="Break Times Image">
      <p>Counts down a period of time, and plays music when the time has ended.  Useful for keeping track of breaks, or how long you need to teach until the next break!</p>

      <h4>Kitten Columns</h4>
      <img src="images/Kitten Counter.png" alt="Kitten Columns Image">
      <p>Have you ever been designing a game in Unity and you needed to know how far apart to space each element to keep them aligned and pretty?  That’s what this simple program is for.  Enter a starting number and an increment, and this will return the next sixteen numbers in the pattern.</p>

      <h4>Choosing Fayyt</h4>
      <img src="images/Hand of Fayyt.png" alt="Choosing Fayyt Image">
      <p>This is the story of the origin of Fayyt Ignatti.  How will your interactions with her shape her heart?  Is her evil on your hands, or was she destined for the darkness long before you met?  A simple text-based, multiple-choice adventure.</p>

      <h4>Castle Fayyt</h4>
      <img src="images/Castle_Fayyt.png" alt="Castle Fayyt Image">
      <p>Millenia after the events of Choosing Fayyt, you adventure into Castle Fayyt to retrieve the Chalice of Riches. Can you survive the evil that still lingers?  Surely after all this time Fayyt Ignatti couldn’t possibly still live, could she?</p>
