                Eckstein Education marries the arts of computer programming and educational software.  Having the experience of twenty years teaching English as a Foreign Language in China, Randall had identified problem areas that most often lie within the Zone of Proximal Development (A term coined by psychologist Lev Vygotsky to define what a person can accomplish with assistanceâ€”as compared to what is easy for that person, and what is beyond their abilities.)  Combining these areas with engaging and intriguing visual and auditory feedback not only helped the students in the classroom, but also improved the quality of the teaching within the school.

                Many of the programs on this site showcase the educational potential of computer programming.  Anything that can be described, vocabulary to be practiced, testing to be conducted, and study-at-home activities can be programmed into a consumable format for young learners and beyond.

                Along with educational software, Randall has developed several games independent of learning.  These games make use of old and new ideas alike.  With the power of Unity, Java, C#, and Python, Randall has created games and program for PC and Android.
